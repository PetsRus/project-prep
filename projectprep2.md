## Summary of Idea
- A pet adoption website where you can view various animals for adoption. There will sections with pictures and profiles for different animals. There will be a section where you can select a specific type pet to view in detail.
- After you select animals for adoption and click "submit", you are directed to a checkout page that says something like "Thank you, {name}! We will send you info for next steps for adopting your next {animals}."
- What problem or pain point does it solve? This project solves the problem of pets not having homes and overcrowding in animal shelters. Gives users the ability to submit pets they found and want to put up for adoption
- MVP: The minimum required is to have a welcome prompt for the users name, then they are taken to the main page where they gallery of animals is displayed for them to browse.
