- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - Dwight - two meetings per day, with team all at the table, one meeting to discuss what we plan to do and the other to recap our work

## Conflict Plan
- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - Be adults, talk it out, understand the KISS (keep it simple silly) principle, take a break/gather thoughts (pros and cons of either action), if needed have a third party decide in case of gridlock
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - The person taking control might not know, so let them be aware of the situation
  - Bring in all team members if one is taking over completely 
  - Prevent this by dividing up tasks each day with equal work, if someone finishes early they help the others
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Check in with team mates, ask for help when you need it, bring up any questions during morning meeting not sit on it and wait
  - Utilize TAs/Audrey for help
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Be professional, ask them “what's going on, why are you stuck?” might be issues not directly related to coding, could be outside/life stuff
  - Scale back work (if needed) to match skill
  - During the morning meeting, review the work that we did to help people who may be weaker in other areas learn 
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - Start with peers (lowest level) then reach out to Audrey if needed, then to Robin (nuclear option)

  - Reach out, watch slack, someone might be working and needs help in the group that's working late.  But also be respectful of what time it is.  Dwight is EST.
